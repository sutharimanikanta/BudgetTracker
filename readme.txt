Alternative Idea: Personal Budget Tracker & Expense Manager
•	User login/signup to manage personal budgets
•	Add, edit, and delete income and expense entries
•	Categorize expenses (food, transport, bills, etc.)
•	Visual summary of monthly spending with simple charts (using Bootstrap cards or minimal JS charts)
•	Export budget and expense data as CSV
•	Use minimal CSS, JavaScript/jQuery for validation & UI effects
•	Flask backend with SQLite for data persistence
